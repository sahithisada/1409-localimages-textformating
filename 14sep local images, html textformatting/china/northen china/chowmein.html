        <h1>About Chow Mein Recipe:</h1>
Making veg chow mein is as easy as stir-frying noodles and veggies together. In fact, if the vegetables are already chopped for you, the whole dish comes together in just minutes! For this reason, I highly recommend you get out your food processor; it’ll make the whole process a snap.

This particular recipe is inspired by the taste of chow mein served from Indian street carts. The tangle of noodles and vegetables are tossed in a tangy-sweet sauce that is nearly addictive. It is a favorite in our house.

Making chowmein recipe at home is actually quite easy, as this recipe will soon show. It is also entirely customizable based on your needs. If you are gluten-free, simply swap in gluten-free noodles of your choice and opt for tamari or coconut aminos in place of the soy sauce.

You can also swap in your own favorite assortment of vegetables, making this a lovely recipe for cleaning out your crisper drawer at the end of the week.

If you are looking for an easy way to get your kids to eat more veggies, this chow mein recipe is a great place to start. For a healthier option I recommend using whole wheat noodles or buckwheat noodles.

<h1>How to Make Chow Mein:</h1>
Veggie Prep and Cooking Noodles
1. Bring 5 cups of water to a boil. Add ¼ teaspoon salt to the water.
water boiling in pan
<br><br>
2. Add 150 to 200 grams noodles. No need to break them. Here I have used hakka noodles. But you can use whole wheat noodles, soba noodles (buckwheat noodles) or chowmein noodles or ramen noodles.
<br><br>
3. Cook the noodles according to package directions.
<br><br>
4. Allow the noodles to cook until tender and softened. You don’t need to cook the noodles al dente as later we only toss the noodles with the stir-fried veggies and do not cook them further. But if you prefer, you can cook them until al dente.
Different types of noodles require different cooking times, so prepare noodles according to the package instructions.

5. Drain the cooked noodles in a colander.
<br><br>
6.  Rinse the noodles very well under running water to stop the cooking process.
<br><br>
7. Add 1 to 2 teaspoons of toasted sesame oil to the noodles. You can also use any neutral-flavored oil.
<br><br>
8. Toss them well so that the oil gets coated evenly on the noodles to prevent them from sticking together. Cover and keep the noodles aside.
<br><br>
9. While the noodles are cooking, chop and grate the veggies. Also chop the button mushrooms. Set aside.
<br><br>
10. Prepare cornflour (aka cornstarch) slurry with 2 teaspoons cornflour and 2 tablespoons water. Keep aside.
<br><br>
11. Heat 2.5 to 3 tablespoons of oil in a pan or wok on medium heat. You can use any neutral-flavored oil.
