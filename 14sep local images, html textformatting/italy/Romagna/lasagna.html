    <h1>Lasagna</h1>
    <p>Lasagna first made is a grand entrance in Naples, Italy during the <mark>Middle Ages in the 14th century.</mark> Initially, this dish was reserved for special events and holidays. Ironically, this pleasure inducing food was introduced to Italians in the middle of the Black Plague.
        Lasagna (UK: /ləˈzænjə/, US: /ləˈzɑːnjə/, Italian: [laˈzaɲɲa]), also known as lasagne ( Italian: [laˈzaɲɲe]), is a type of pasta, possibly one of the oldest types, made in very wide, flat sheets.

<h1>Directions:</h1>
<h4>step1:</h4>
Gather all your ingredients.
<h4>step2:</h4>
Cook sausage, ground beef, onion, and garlic in a Dutch oven over medium heat until well browned.
<h4>step3:</h4>
Stir in crushed tomatoes, tomato sauce, tomato paste, and water. Season with sugar, 2 tablespoons parsley, basil, 1 teaspoon salt, Italian seasoning, fennel seeds, and pepper. Simmer, covered, for about 1 ½ hours, stirring occasionally.
<h4>step4:</h4>
Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook lasagna noodles in boiling water for 8 to 10 minutes. Drain noodles, and rinse with cold water.
<h4>step5:</h4>
In a mixing bowl, combine ricotta cheese with egg, remaining 2 tablespoons parsley, and 1/2 teaspoon salt.
<h4>step6:</h4>
Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
<h4>step7:</h4>
To assemble, spread 1 ½ cups of meat sauce in the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking dish. Arrange 6 noodles lengthwise over meat sauce, overlapping slightly. Spread with 1/2 of the ricotta cheese mixture. Top with 1/3 of the mozzarella cheese slices. Spoon 1 ½ cups meat sauce over mozzarella, and sprinkle with 1/4 cup Parmesan cheese.
<h4>step8:</h4>
Repeat layers, and top with remaining mozzarella and Parmesan cheese. Cover with foil: to prevent sticking, either spray foil with cooking spray or make sure the foil does not touch the cheese.
<h4>step9:</h4>
Bake in the preheated oven for 25 minutes. Remove the foil and bake for an additional 25 minutes.
<h4>step10:</h4>
Rest lasagna for 15 minutes before serving.
