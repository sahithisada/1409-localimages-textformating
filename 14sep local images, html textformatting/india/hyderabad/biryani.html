    <h1>Biryani</h1>
    <p>
        Biryani (/bɜːrˈjɑːni/) is a mixed rice dish, mainly popular in South Asia. It is made with rice, some type of meat (chicken, goat, lamb, beef, prawn, or fish) and spices. To cater to vegetarians, in some cases, it is prepared by substituting vegetables or paneer for the meat.Sometimes eggs and/or potatoes are also added.
        <br><br>
        Biryani is one of the <i>most popular dishes in South Asia</i> and among the South Asian diaspora, although the dish is often associated with the region's Muslim population in particular.[3] Similar dishes are also prepared in other parts of the world such as in Iran, Iraq, Myanmar, Thailand, and Malaysia. Biryani is the single most-ordered dish on Indian online food ordering and delivery services, and has been labelled as the most popular dish overall in India.

Process to form a smooth paste.

<br><br>
Cover and refrigerate for at least 4 hours or overnight if time permits.
<br><br>
<h3>Biryani Masala Powder:</h3>
Place all the ingredients for the masala powder – cloves, cinnamon, cardamom, cumin and peppercorns – in a mortar and pestle or spice grinder. Grind it to a coarse powder. Set aside.
<h3>Rice:</h3>
Rinse rice under cold running water until water runs clear. Soak in water for 30 minutes.

<h2>Hyderabadi Biryani:</h2>
Heat 3 tbsp ghee and 1 tbsp oil in a heavy bottomed pan over medium-high heat.
<br><br>
Add chicken (or mutton) and biryani masala powder.
<br><br>
Fry, stirring occasionally, for about 5-6 minutes. (If using mutton, cook for 7-8 minutes).
<br><br>
Make sure chicken is arranged in one layer.
<br><br>
Add the next layer – half of rice, 1 tsp ghee and half of caramelized onion. 
<br><br>
Scatter over half of chopped coriander leaves. Pour in half of saffron milk.
<br><br>
Repeat layer with rest of rice, 1 tsp ghee, and rest of caramelized onions. Scatter over rest of the chopped coriander leaves.
<br><br>
Pour in rest of saffron milk.
<br><br>
Cover the casserole with a very tight fitting lid. 
<br><br>
This is very important as we don’t want steam to escape.
<br><br>
To ensure the lid is really tight, Cover the casserole with aluminium foil and then place the lid on top.
<br><br>
Place the casserole on a tawa. 
<br><br>
Cook biryani over high heat for 5 minutes, then over medium heat for 15 minutes, and finally over low heat for 10 minutes.

Remove from heat. 
<br><br>
Let it stand for 10 minutes before opening the lid.
<br><br>
Garnish with the reserved caramelized onions, and more chopped coriander leaves if you like.
